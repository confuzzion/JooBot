This is an update log of joo bot

5.12.2020 Started working on Joo bot
Here is the General outline, I don't have enough chat data of joo to actually make a neural network bot. So we have to settle for something a little simpler. 
I'll have to just manually code in all of the responses and test. It might be possible to get some kind of learning in eg: What's your name? Chris *Bot creates catagory for Chris*
The problem is not the answers, but the question. Human language is dumb, and inefficientm, however there is no permanent fix besides death to that so we'll just have to work around it. 

I am extremely uncertain of the likely hood of success of this project. The hindenburg was also extremely promising and doable, yet we crashed that one too.

Added User interface, user can now actually speak, no response however

5.26.2020
Started screwing around with machine learning and AIML libraries. Have a rought chatbot shell, but no Joo Bot personality. Acts like just any other chat bot, need to edit in JooBot personality.
There is no documentation for the AIML library I'm using. I've read at least a few thousand lines of the library. The sun is coming up.

Joobot actually works, the UI I made and the machine learning library actually are integrated. I've read thousands of lines of source code for the library to finnally read custom 
phrases and AIML files. I also had to learn how to write AIML, and then deal with the folders. Good god, I spent at least 1.5 hours on just file systems. The library
for some reason, never like the way the folders were inputed. It took using java to automatically get the folders through the file api for the ALICE/AIML api to recognize the location of
the custom bots. I don't see the sun this time, but I can feel the hours. This is basically alpha 1.0, as all I need to do now is actually write up the AIML files, or examples of what 
joo might respond too.
